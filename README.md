# cardwire

a GPU manager for Linux using eBPF LSM hooks to block GPUs

## Prerequisites

Before using `cardwire`, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Linux Kernel**: version 5.7 or later
- **eBPF LSM Support**: Your kernel must have `CONFIG_BPF_LSM=y`

### How to check:
```bash
# Check kernel version (should be >= 5.7)
uname -r

# Check if BPF LSM is enabled in your kernel
zgrep CONFIG_BPF_LSM /proc/config.gz || grep CONFIG_BPF_LSM /boot/config-$(uname -r)

# Check if 'bpf' is in the active LSM list
cat /sys/kernel/security/lsm
```

## Usage

The `cardwire` CLI allows you to manage GPU states and system modes

### Modes
- **Manual**: Default mode for safety, allows individual GPU blocking/unblocking
- **Integrated**: Automatically blocks the discrete GPU 
- **Hybrid**: Enables the dGPU for use (unblocked)

**Note :** Integrated/Hybrid modes only work on host with two GPUs

```bash
# Set system mode
cardwire set integrated/hybrid/manual

# Get current mode status
cardwire get

# List all detected GPUs and their status
cardwire list

# Manually block/unblock a specific GPU by ID
cardwire gpu 1 block on
cardwire gpu 1 block off

# Get detailed info for a specific GPU, will probably be deprecated
cardwire gpu 1 info
```

## Configuration

The daemon reads its configuration from `/etc/cardwire.toml`. If the file is missing, it defaults to `Manual` mode. (Config parsing not tested yet)

```toml
# /etc/cardwire.toml
mode = "Manual"
```

## Building and Development

### Using Nix

```bash
# Enter development shell
nix develop

# Build the project
nix build
```

### Manual Compilation
If you don't use Nix, ensure you have `clang`, `llvm`, and `cargo` installed (needed for eBPF compilation during the Rust build)

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Install binaries, systemd service, and D-Bus config (requires sudo)
sudo make install
```

## How it works

Cardwire uses eBPF with LSM hooks to intercept file operations on GPU device nodes, such as `/dev/dri/renderDX` and `/dev/dri/cardX`, and sysfs `config` file

When a GPU is "blocked," the eBPF program returns `-ENOENT` for any `open` syscall targeting that device. This provides several key benefits:

*   **Instant App Startup:** Prevents applications (like Electron apps, Steam or Lutris) from attempting to initialize the GPU, this eliminates the 3–4 second "hang" typically caused by waiting for a sleeping GPU to power up
*   **Power Efficiency:** By blocking access at the syscall level, the GPU is never woken from its lowest power state (D3cold), extending battery life for laptops
*   **Non-Invasive:** Unlike traditional methods that might require driver unloading or complex X11/Wayland configurations, this approach is transparent to the rest of the system and easily toggled

## Project Structure

- `crates/cardwire-core`: Low-level GPU and IOMMU discovery
- `crates/cardwire-daemon`: System daemon managing state and D-Bus communication
- `crates/cardwire-cli`: User CLI to interact with the daemon
- `crates/cardwire-ebpf`: BPF program and LSM hooks

## Notes
- I'm not a senior dev,, if you think the code is objectively bad, feel free to make a PR
- Credit to Gemini 3.1 pro for the first version of ebpf and some functions, i'm currently in the process of rewritting everything from scratch without ai for learning purpose and self-satisfaction
- Credits to asus-linux discord for helping me find this ebpf method
