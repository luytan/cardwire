A GPU manager for Linux using eBPF LSM hooks to block GPUs

# Disclaimer
- This project is in early development. Expect bugs and incomplete functionality
- The Makefile was AI-generated, i only use the flake.nix, be careful
## Requirements
- **Linux Kernel**: version 5.7 or later
- **eBPF LSM**: Your kernel must have `CONFIG_BPF_LSM=y`, and you must enable LSM on your system
## Quick Start
**Arch:**
```bash
yay -S cardwire
```
**Nix with flakes:**

flake.nix:
```nix
    cardwire = {
      url = "github:luytan/cardwire";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
```
then import:
```nix
  imports = [
    inputs.cardwire.nixosModules.default
  ];
  services.cardwire.enable = true;
```
## Usage

The `cardwire` CLI lets you manage GPU states and system modes

### Modes
- **Integrated**: Blocks the discrete GPU 
- **Hybrid**: Unblocks the discrete GPU
- **Manual**: Default mode for safety, allows individual GPU blocking/unblocking

_Note: Integrated/Hybrid modes only work on host with two GPUs_

_Note 2: Manual mode is not implemented_
```bash
# Set system mode
cardwire set integrated / hybrid / manual

# Get current mode status
cardwire get

# List all detected GPUs and their status
cardwire list

# Manually block/unblock a specific GPU by ID
cardwire gpu 1 --block
cardwire gpu 1 --unblock
```

## Configuration

The daemon reads its configuration from `/var/lib/cardwire/cardwire.toml`. If the file is missing, it defaults to `Manual` mode.

```toml
# /var/lib/cardwire/cardwire.toml
mode = "Manual"
block_vulkan = false
```
`block_vulkan` is an experimental feature that blocks the nvidia's vulkan icd, must be used with caution

## Building and Development

### Using Nix

```bash
# Enter development shell
nix develop

# Build the project
nix build

# Run formatting checks
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.pre-commit-check

# Run integration tests in VM
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.vm-test

# Build the vm and enter
nix run .#nixosConfigurations.x86_64-linux.config.system.build.vm
```

### Manual Compilation
If you don't use Nix, ensure you have `clang`, `libbpf` and `cargo` installed (needed for eBPF compilation during the Rust build)

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Install binaries, systemd service, and D-Bus config (requires sudo)
sudo make install
```

## How it works

Cardwire uses eBPF with LSM hooks to intercept file operations on GPU device nodes, such as `/dev/dri/renderDX`, `/dev/dri/cardX`, sysfs `config` and `nvidiaX`

When a GPU is "blocked," the eBPF program returns `-ENOENT` for any syscall targeting that device. This provides several key benefits:

*   **Instant App Startup:** Prevents applications (like Electron apps or GTK apps) from attempting to initialize the GPU, this eliminates the 3–4 second "hang" typically caused by waiting for a sleeping GPU to power up
*   **Power Efficiency:** By blocking access at the syscall level, the GPU is never woken from its lowest power state (D3cold), extending battery life on laptops
*   **Non-Invasive:** Unlike traditional methods that might require driver unloading, risky unbind or complex X11/Wayland setups, this approach is transparent to the rest of the system and easy to toggle
*   _Also works with games_

## Project Structure
- `crates/cardwire-cli`: User CLI to interact with the daemon
- `crates/cardwire-core`: Low-level GPU manager and IOMMU discovery
- `crates/cardwire-daemon`: System daemon managing state and D-Bus communication
- `crates/cardwire-ebpf`: BPF program and LSM hooks

## Notes
- I'm still learning Rust, if some parts of the code are bad or unoptimized, feel free to open a PR
## Credits
- Asus-linux Discord for helping me find the ebpf method
- Caelestia shell for the flake.nix, i used it as a reference
